    "**A Structured Output Agent in LangChain (or other LLM frameworks) refers to an agent that produces responses in a specific structured format, such as JSON, dictionaries, or other structured data types. These agents are particularly useful when you want to ensure that your responses conform to a defined schema, making it easier to parse, validate, and utilize in downstream applications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Use a Structured Output Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Controlled Responses: Ensures that the outputs follow a specific format, reducing ambiguity.\n",
    "- Data Validation: Useful when you want the model output to fit predefined structures, like for APIs or database entries.\n",
    "- Automation: Makes integration with systems like dashboards, ETL pipelines, or business workflows easier."
