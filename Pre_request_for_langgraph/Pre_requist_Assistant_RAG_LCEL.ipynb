MCP provides a universal interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts. Following its announcement, the protocol was adopted by major AI providers, including OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n",

      "Page: Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to retrieve and incorporate new information. With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM's pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information that is not available in the training data. For example, this helps LLM-based chatbots access internal company data or generate responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have caused chatbots to describe policies that don't exist, or recommend nonexistent legal cases to lawyers that are looking for citations to support their arguments.\n",
      "RAG also reduces the need to retrain LLMs with new data, saving on computational and financial costs. Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include sources in their responses, so users can verify the cited sources. This provides greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",
      "The term RAG was first introduced in a 2020 research paper from Meta.\n"

       "  'content': 'When we saw lower ticket demand last June, we immediately cut discretionary spending. We stopped all fixed asset improvements, paused new projects and limited travel. Seasonal hiring was slowed, and in July all department heads were directed to reduce all expenses. After the Burning Man event, we had a formal reduction in force (RIF), reducing headcount by 10%. We renegotiated key contracts and cut expenses throughout the organization. [...] Looking back, the burn in 2024 was damn good, especially after two challenging years of difficult weather. The vibe was great and morale remained sky-high throughout the week, sunrises and sunsets were spectacular and it was bookended by smooth ingress and egress that led to making Black Rock City rock on all levels. [...] Today, Burning Man Project CEO Marian Goodell emailed the latest update to the Burning Man community — it contains information about adapting to 2024 financial challenges, expresses deep gratitude for the community, and looks forward with excitement to the best Burning Man ever in 2025, enhanced by streamlined process and a new pay-it-forward ticket model. We’ve shared it here in its entirety. Please give it a read and help us keep Burning Man alive!\\n\\nHello friends and community members,',\n",
